# www.horses.quest

A website that hosts a gallery for horse images scraped from my instagram saved posts. There's a local python script (I'll upload once it's cleaned up) that's scheduled
to run bi-weekly that downloads all my saved horse pics. My algorithm gives me at least 5 new horse pics every day, so it's
always getting new pics! The gallery PHP was written by samsermolla (https://github.com/samsermolla/Image-Gallery-from-a-Directory-or-Folder).
